                <h1>JAVA SCRIPT</h1>
                <p>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on
                    web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for
                    you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics,
                    scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third
                    layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in
                    much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.</p>

                <h1>BOOTSTRAP</h1>
                <p>
                    Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS and JavaScript framework for developing a responsive and
                    mobile friendly website.
                    It is absolutely free to download and use.
                    It is a front-end framework used for easier and faster web development.
                    It includes HTML and CSS based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables, navigation,
                    modals, image carousels and many others.
                    It can also use JavaScript plug-ins.
                    It facilitates you to create responsive designs.

                <h1>REACT JS</h1>
                <p>React JS is a JavaScript library, commonly used to develop software that is constantly refreshing
                    data on its UI. This technology eliminates the need of reloading the whole screen and also avoids
                    processing every single line of code. React JS allows you to create components actually made with
                    JavaScript; the famous scripting language used to create interactive applications and interfaces. If
                    you’re using an app that is constantly updating its data, then it was probably developed with
                    JavaScript.</p>

                <p>At a high level, GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage
                    their code, as well as track and control changes to their code. To understand exactly what GitHub
                    is, you need to know two connected principles:

                    1. Version control
                    2. Git

                <h1>NODE JS</h1>
                <p>
                    Node.js is an open-source server side runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It
                    provides an event driven, non-blocking (asynchronous) I/O and cross-platform runtime environment for
                    building highly scalable server-side application using JavaScript.

                    Node.js can be used to build different types of applications such as command line application, web
                    application, real-time chat application, REST API server etc. However, it is mainly used to build
                    network programs like web servers, similar to PHP, Java, or ASP.NET.

                <h1>TAILWIND CSS</h1>
                <p>Tailwind CSS can be used to make websites in the fastest and the easiest way.

                    Tailwind CSS is basically a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
                    It is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you
                    need to build bespoke designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override.
                    The beauty of this thing called tailwind is it doesn’t impose design specification or how your site
                    should look like, you simply bring tiny components together to construct a user interface that is
                    unique. What Tailwind simply does is take a ‘raw’ CSS file, processes this CSS file over a
                    configuration file, and produces an output.</p>
